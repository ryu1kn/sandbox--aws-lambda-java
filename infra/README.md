# Infra

The contents is originally generated with `cdk init app --language java`

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

It is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) based project, so you can open this project
with any Maven compatible Java IDE to build and run tests.

## Prerequisites

* yarn (used to install aws-cdk in the current directory)
* maven
* JDK 8

## Build

To build this app, you need to be in this example's root folder. Then run the following:

```sh
yarn install
```

Create resources for AWS CDK to store assets (replace `<account-id>` and `<region>`)

```sh
yarn cdk bootstrap aws://<account-id>/<region>
```

## Deploy

```sh
yarn cdk deploy
```

This will deploy / redeploy your Stack to your AWS Account.

After the deployment you will see the API's URL, which represents the url you can then use.

## Synthesize Cloudformation Template

To see the Cloudformation template generated by the CDK, run:

```sh
yarn cdk synth
```

then check the output file in the "cdk.out" directory.

## Other useful commands

* `mvn package`     compile and run tests
* `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation
